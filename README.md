# Test

## What is this?
This is a repo for testing!

## What can I test here?
Anything related to github/git and how it works. 

## What do I after conducting a test?
This is not a requirement, but it'd be great if you wrote down what you tested and what the results were. 

## Conducted tests
1: On Github mobile (maybe desktop too, but definitely on mobile) you can see the revert button on PRs to repos you don't have access to. What does pressing this button do? It attempts to create a PR with the reversion of the PR. Reference: #1
